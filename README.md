# Description

The Investment and Bond Calculator allows you to perform two calculations:

1. Investment: Calculate the amount of interest you'll earn on your investment. You can choose between simple and compound interest. The calculator asks for the deposit amount, interest rate, and the number of years for the deposit.

2. Bond: Calculate the monthly repayment amount for a home loan. The calculator asks for the property value, interest rate, and the total repayment time in months.

The calculator provides accurate results based on the input values, giving you an idea of the potential interest or monthly repayment for your investment or bond.
